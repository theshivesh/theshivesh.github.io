                                we plan to conduct targeted user surveys and
                                focus groups to gain deeper insights into user
                                preferences, pain points, and aspirations. By
                                closely monitoring user feedback, we aim to
                                refine the user interface, optimize performance
                                further, and introduce features that directly
                                align with user needs. Our team will also delve
                                into advanced AI model development, focusing on
                                increasing the accuracy and diversity of
                                artistic styles generated by Picto AI.

                                feedback, we are committed to expanding our
                                educational resources, providing users with even

                                Picto AI. Recognizing the global market
                                penetration achieved, we will work on
                                localization efforts, ensuring that Picto AI is

                                across diverse regions. Collaborative tools will
                                be a focal point, as we aim to introduce more
                                robust features for real-time collaboration and
                                project sharing, fostering an even more dynamic
